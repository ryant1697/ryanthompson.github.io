                    an egg was created, and hatched from this egg was the legendary Pokémon Arceus (shown above). 
                    Also known as “The Original One,” Arceus is widely regarded as the creator of the entire Pokémon Universe. 
                    With this legendary beast, comes the creation of the Lake Guardians: Uxie, Mesprit, and Azelf, who each reside over the three lakes of Sinnoh, as well as the Creation Trio: Dialga, Palkia, and Giratina.
                    In order to assist in the formation of the Pokémon world, Dialga, Palkia, and Giratina were each given power over their own respective dimensions. 
                    Dialga was given space, Palkia was given time, and Giratina was given control over antimatter, and later, the Distortion World – an alternate dimension designed as a punishment by Arceus. 
                    Together, they created the entire Pokémon world as we know it today.</p>
